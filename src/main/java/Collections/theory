DS is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively

Linked list is a sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also containing data
last node points to null --means there is no more data
Singly linked list only hold a reference to the next node while in doubly linked list each node holds a reference to the next and previous node
